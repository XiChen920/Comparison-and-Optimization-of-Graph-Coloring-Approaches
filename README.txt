Graph Colouring
A graph G is essentially a collection of vertices connected by lines. 
The chromatic number of G is simply the minimum number of colours you need to colour the points, such that no two vertices that are connected by a line have the same colour. 
The project is written in the Java programming language.

General Information
A program is implemented in Java to read in a graph from a text file and then computes the upper bound, lower bound and in some cases the exact chromatic number of a graph. 

Installing
To run this project, you will need to install the Java Software Development Kit (JDK) for your specific operating system. 
For this project Java SE 14 was used.

Run the Program
You will first of all have to open a command prompt. 
Then enter java -jar GROUP29.jar name_of_the_graph.txt to calculate the chromatic number of a graph. 
You will have to replace name_of_the_graph with the name of your graph file to calculate the chromatic number of it.   
Be also sure to place graphs and bat file in the same folder
